    "description": "EssentialsX officially supports the **CraftBukkit**, **Spigot**, and [**Paper (recommended)**](https://papermc.io/) server software:\n\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **1.16.4** - EssentialsX actively develops against and supports these versions\n‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è **1.8.8**, **1.9.4**, **1.10.2**, **1.11.2**, **1.12.2**, **1.13.2**, **1.14.4**, and **1.15.2** - these versions are still supported, but are not a priority for us, and may be dropped in a future release\n\n\n**EssentialsX does NOT support the following Minecraft versions or server software:**\n\n‚Ä¢ üõë **Do not use Mohist or Magma on your server. These server implementations include dangerous, non-standard behavior, such as altering the Bukkit permissions system and modifying EssentialsX at runtime.**\n‚Ä¢ üõë Cauldron, Thermos, CatServer, or any other Forge/Bukkit hybrid server software - the Bukkit API does not properly support mods, and using Bukkit plugins with modded Forge servers will cause significant stability problems.\nFor Forge 1.12.2 servers, use [**SpongeForge**](https://www.spongepowered.org/) and [**Nucleus**](https://nucleuspowered.org/) for a complete Essentials replacement, or consider an alternative mod designed for **Forge** or **Fabric** instead of EssentialsX.\n‚Ä¢ üõë **1.7.10 or below** - you should use the original [**Essentials**](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/essentials).\n\n\n**We strongly recommend using the [latest version of Paper](https://papermc.io/downloads)**, as it includes countless bug fixes and performance improvements over Spigot and CraftBukkit, including fixing some non-vanilla behaviors in Spigot and CraftBukkit. EssentialsX includes significant improvements when run on Paper which are impossible to achieve on Spigot or CraftBukkit, such as asynchronous non-blocking teleportation and support for modern gameplay features.",
