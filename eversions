    "description": "EssentialsX officially supports the **CraftBukkit**, **Spigot**, and [**Paper (recommended)**](https://papermc.io/) server software running the following Minecraft versions:\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **1.16.5** - EssentialsX actively develops against and supports these versions.\n‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è **1.8.8**, **1.9.4**, **1.10.2**, **1.11.2**, **1.12.2**, **1.13.2**, **1.14.4**, and **1.15.2** - these versions are still supported, but are not a priority for us, and may be dropped in a future release.\n\nEssentialsX **does not support** the following Minecraft versions and server software:\n‚Ä¢ üõë Do not use **Akarin**, **Yatopia**, **Mohist**, or **Magma** as your server software. These servers include dangerous non-standard behavior which can not only impact EssentialsX's functionality but also cause damage to your worlds.\n‚Ä¢ üõë Any Forge/Fabric hybrid server software, including **Cauldron**, **Thermos**, **CatServer**, **Mohist**, and **Magma** - the Bukkit API does not properly support mods, and using Bukkit plugins on modded Forge/Fabric servers will cause significant problems.\nFor Forge servers, use [**SpongeForge**](https://www.spongepowered.org/downloads/spongeforge) with [**Nucleus**](https://nucleuspowered.org) for plugin support and a complete Essentials replacement, or consider a mod designed for Forge such as [**FTB Essentials**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-essentials).\n‚Ä¢ üõë **1.7.10 or below** - you should use the original [**Essentials**](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/essentials).\n\n***We will not be able to provide support if you use any of the unsupported software or versions listed above.***",
